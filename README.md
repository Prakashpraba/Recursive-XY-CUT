# Recursive XY CUT Algorithm üîÅ‚úÇÔ∏è

 I'm creating a C# repository to implement a recursive algorithm for xy-plane cutting, allowing for efficient subdivision and manipulation of two-dimensional space.
 
## Overview üòÄ
This repository contains an implementation of the Recursive XY CUT algorithm in C#. The Recursive XY CUT algorithm is used for efficient subdivision and manipulation of two-dimensional space by recursively dividing a given area into smaller rectangles along the x and y axes.

## Before and After Sections of the Images

### Before
Before applying the Recursive XY CUT algorithm, the input image represents the initial undivided space or region.

### After
After applying the Recursive XY CUT algorithm, the input image is subdivided into smaller rectangles along the x and y axes, resulting in a segmented representation of the space.

## Usage ‚ùî
To use the Recursive XY CUT algorithm in your C# project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `RecursiveXYCUT` directory.
3. Include the necessary files in your project.
4. Utilize the provided functions to perform xy-plane cutting as needed.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Kudos üôè
I'd like to give special thanks to [GitHub Owner's Name](https://github.com/Sanster) who has achieved this in python, which i have now converted to C#.
