# Recursive-XY-CUT üîÅ‚úÇÔ∏è
 creating a C# repository to implement a recursive algorithm for xy-plane cutting, allowing for efficient subdivision and manipulation of two-dimensional space.
# Recursive XY CUT Algorithm

## Overview üòÄ
This repository contains an implementation of the Recursive XY CUT algorithm in C#. The Recursive XY CUT algorithm is used for efficient subdivision and manipulation of two-dimensional space by recursively dividing a given area into smaller rectangles along the x and y axes.

## Before and After Sections of the Images

### Before
Before applying the Recursive XY CUT algorithm, the input image represents the initial undivided space or region.

### After
After applying the Recursive XY CUT algorithm, the input image is subdivided into smaller rectangles along the x and y axes, resulting in a segmented representation of the space.

## Usage
To use the Recursive XY CUT algorithm in your C# project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `RecursiveXYCUT` directory.
3. Include the necessary files in your project.
4. Utilize the provided functions to perform xy-plane cutting as needed.
